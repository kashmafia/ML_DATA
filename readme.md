# Final Project ReadMe

## Running Part 1
To run the classification algorithms, we need to first fill in the missing values. Please use the code for part 2 (**missing.py**) on the datasets of part 1 to do this. In order to do this, change the filepath in the reading of CSVs in Part 2 to the path of the datasets of Part 1 and also use the appropriate delimiter. Also, change the name of the output to what you want it to be.

Once, the missing values have been filled in, you can basically just run **knn.py** which is the classification algorithm. Make sure to use the appropriate filepaths.
